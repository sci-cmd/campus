# campus
The school system in a digital space.
In this app, students can recieve lectures as notes from teachers, take tests or exams and have them graded and given back to them. Admins are the ones in control as they have the ability to add/remove teachers, assign teachers to classes, create a timetable for the teachers to follow and even add/remove students.
